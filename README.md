I used multithreading and concurrent programming, network programming, and graphical user interface components in Python. I developed develop a clientserver application for a library based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

Authentication: When the client application is started and the connection is established with the server, the server will send a confirmation message to the client (message: connectionsuccess). Once this message is received, the client will then show the following login screen to take the username and password from the user (See Figure 2).

When the "Close" button is clicked,the connection between the client and the server will be terminated, and the window will be destroyed.

Thread Synchronization: You should consider the RLock thread synchronization technique to deal with any problems caused by attempting to access the shared data at the same file
